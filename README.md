# RtkKotlinAndroid

RTK is a bunch of wrappers around things I use too often to mess with their default interfaces. Note that it's in no way a full fledged library, things are added in order in which I need them in my projects and those which I don't usually aren't and won't get implemented unless I'll need them somewhere.

This is its Kotlin version for Android.

## Usage

As already stated, this library is primarily intended for my own projects, aiming to speed up their development. But since the GNU LGPL licence doesn't prevent you from using it, if you for whatever reason wanted to, just follow the instruction from [Jitpack's](https://jitpack.io/) website.

The testing application shows the usage of some of the currently implemented features like gesture detection (TouchWrapper) or playing sounds (which by the way currently use max. one stream at time, so playing multiple sounds at once will most likely be bit troublesome.).
